# portfolio

My portfolio page is built with HTML, CSS, and JS jQuery. I built similar sites using wordPress prior to this class, so I had a good idea on the style I wanted for my own site. I had never built one with code from scratch, so that was a challenege, but I'm happy with the result!

I created a mobile hamburger menu, as well as some accordian links to show/hide information on the page. My other games/projects are also all playable through the projects page.
